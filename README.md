# MVVM with Jetpack Compose Example

This repository contains a basic example of using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture with Jetpack Compose in Kotlin. The project illustrates how to structure a simple application that utilizes a ViewModel to handle business logic and UI state, while the Jetpack Compose framework is used to build the UI.

## Overview

The example includes:
- A `User` model class that represents the user data.
- A `UserViewModel` class that manages the users' data and any related operations.
- A Jetpack Compose UI component that observes data changes and displays the user information.
